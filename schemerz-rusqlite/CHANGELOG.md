- **IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGE**: `schemerz_rusqlite::RusqliteAdapter::new` now
  uses a default table name of `_schemerz` when the `table_name` argument is
  `None`. If you were not setting this argument before and are migrating from
  `schemer`, you will need to set `table_name` to `Some("_schemer".into())`.

## [0.290.0] - 2024-10-15
Initial release. The API is identical to `schemer-rusqlite 0.2.2`.
